forked from JupterLab, lab for quant

**QuantLab is a very early developer preview, and is not suitable for
general usage yet. Features and implementation are subject to change.**

----

## Prerequisites

Jupyter notebook version 4.2 or later. To check the notebook version:

```bash
jupyter notebook --version
```

### Supported Runtimes

The runtime versions which are currently *known to work*:

- Firefox 49+
- Chrome 39+
- Safari 10+

Earlier browser versions may also work, but come with no guarantees.

QuantLab uses CSS Variables for styling, which is one reason for the
minimum versions listed above.  IE 11+ or Edge 14 do not support
CSS Variables, and are not directly supported at this time.
A tool like [postcss](http://postcss.org/) can be used to convert the CSS files in the
`quantlab/build` directory manually if desired.

----

## Installation

If you use ``conda``, you can install as:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge quantlab
```

If you use ``pip``, you can install it as:

```bash
pip install quantlab
jupyter serverextension enable --py quantlab --sys-prefix
```

Start up QuantLab:

```bash
jupyter quantlab
```

QuantLab will open automatically in your browser. You may also access
QuantLab by entering the notebook server's URL (`http://localhost:8888`) in
the browser.

Instructions on how to install the project from the git sources are available in our [contributor documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Note: If installing using `pip install --user`, you must add the user-level
 `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable in order to launch
 `jupyter quantlab`.


## Extensions

The QuantLab environment can be extended using extensions.  See documentation
for [users](https://quantlab-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions_user.html) and [developers](https://quantlab-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions_dev.html).
